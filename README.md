_⚠️ work in progress ⚠️_

Viscous.js is a simple and straightforward templating engine, similar to Liquid(.js). It's different though, in that:

- operator precedence is taken into account, andnested parenthesized expressions are allowed
- helper function calls can be used

It doesn't yet have feature parity, because these things are still missing:

- loops and other kinds of iteration
- filters
- etc.
